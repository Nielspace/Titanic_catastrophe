## A kaggle problem

For those who new to Machine Learnig this is a best way to start. Kaggle provides data that can help to you shape your
knowledge and help you to discover more that machine learning.

### Importing the libraries 
Make sure that you import libraries according to the requirement. In the beginning I used Pandas as the intial libraries. Second make sure that the csv files are imported.

### Visualization
Visualization is important it helps us to see which features are important and which features can be eliminated. 

### Feature Engineering 
This is the important process because here you get the model ready and eliminate all the un-important features and 
convert the features according to the requirements. 
#### Feature Engineering includes:
<ul>data-mapping</ul>
<ul>droping features</ul>

### Modeling 
This is the final stage where we use different classifiers to predict the accuracy of the model.

### Conclusion
By using adding and subtracting different features we can play with models. Different features gives different predictions. 
As a data-scienctist our job is to get close to 100%. There are quite a few different models which gives better prediction than the others.
